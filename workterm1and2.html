          <h2>About CCS</h2>
          <p>My position as Student Consultant for the CCS Help Centre and IT Help Desk meant that I was the first contact for those on campus with IT issues or questions. Over my two co-op work terms (April 2019 - December 2019), this meant that students, faculty, staff, and visitors were in contact with me about a number of issues, which spanned from how to connect to wifi to the university’s regulations for secure storage for research data. Clients were able to get in touch with the Help Centre by phone, email, or online chat, or in-person at the Help Desk. I was responsible for properly answering or directing the many requests that clients could make.</p>

                  <p>One of my goals was to improve my ability to effectively translate and explain technical concepts to people with limited technical knowledge or skills. The ability to communicate abstract ideas and high-level concepts is not only incredibly important in a customer-service oriented job, but it also requires an in-depth understanding of those concepts, and what tools are best suited for communicating them. </p>
                  <p>After working with the university systems for 8 months, I developed a profound understanding of the difference between knowing how to use those systems, and how to teach others how to use them. I began to understand the varied approaches needed when helping clients over the phone, in person, or through email, and was able to select the most effective approaches to be able to best help clients. This allowed me to not only solve the problem, but I was able to teach clients the skills to solve them on their own in the future.

                  <p>However, knowing the specifics of particular systems can only do so much. Understanding the client was integral to understanding the problem, and I had to work on asking the right questions to get the right answers, as well as communicating those answers in an effective way.  In order to provide the best solution, I needed to not only understand how to use diverse systems that I was interacting with, but how to interact most effectively with the client.</p>

                  <p>When the client-base is as large as the University, problems can often arise that you’ve not seen before, and the services that CCS provides are varied and can be quite specific. When entering this position, I found myself overwhelmed trying to remember how to resolve each request that could be made. Thankfully, there were many resources at my disposal, such as a knowledge base of articles with documented troubleshooting and solutions and documents that outlined our different services and teams. My supervisor was also always available for and encouraged questions. I resolved that I would get to know and be comfortable using every resource available to me, and educate myself on as many known issues as possible.</p>
                  <p>Wayfinding among informational systems in an environment like the help centre was crucial in my ability to perform as effectively as possible. Not only was I required to be able to effectively troubleshoot and solve problems, but I needed to be able to navigate the operational infrastructure of the entire organization in order to direct requests to those who could resolve them. I was strengthening this wayfinding and operational knowledge daily, as it was required for every request that came in. By the end of the work terms I found that when dealing with uncommon problems, I knew where to find the answer, and which resources would be most helpful in creating solutions.</p>

                  <p>Throughout the work terms, I was exposed to lots of examples of internal documentation and communication of troubleshooting and solutions. Seeing all of this documentation everyday strengthened my ability to document solutions, and I made it a goal to contribute to our documentation of solutions for clients on our webpages. Creating that documentation meant I had to think about the difference between internal and external documentation, and the ways communicating with clients differed from communicating with colleagues. I was already doing this for every ticket I created or updated, as I would take notes and information from internal documentation and use that to update clients on the status of their requests, or offer them troubleshooting steps.</p>
                  <p>From there, I was able to update web pages like our Recent Scams and Phishing page, which contains information about recent phishing emails clients had notified us about, which entailed taking internal documentation from our security team and presenting it in a way that clients could understand. I also took on the project of updating the ResNet pages for wifi in residence. This meant that I needed to read through the outdated pages, compare them to the internal documentation for the new process of connecting as created by our Networking team, and write documentation that outlined those new processes in a way that would be easiest for clients to understand and follow with little confusion.</p>

                  <p>All of these goals I had set for myself, and the skills I was developing as a result, were integral in allowing me to be as productive and effective as possible when helping clients. This was not just good for my own work, but for my colleagues as well. The better I was at my own job, the less that my team members would need to do to support me. As part-time staff began to start working again after the summer, I was sure to keep being a good team-member, in coordinating shared tasks, and picking up work or tickets that had been started by others to ensure that client requests weren’t forgotten. </p>
                  <p>What I learned was that all the foundational work I had done had made me extremely adept at picking up work or answering questions from my own colleagues, and I myself had become a resource for finding the right solution to a problem.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>I was very fortunate for my position as a Student Consultant for CCS at the University of Guelph. I gained a wide understanding of the multitude of careers and areas of application for a computer science or software engineering degree, and the different ways that information technologies are applicable to campus life. I also heavily strengthened a myriad of my interpersonal or “soft skills”, which will help in my transition to other roles throughout my co-op career and after graduation. I learned a lot about the field of technological support, and a lot about myself and my abilities within that field.</p>

          <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
          <p>I’d like to thank my supervisor Jill for two fantastic work terms, and all her work that she put in to ensure that I was comfortable and able to perform in my role. Her support was a huge resource that I leaned on time and time again. I’d also like to thank my team members for a memorable 8 months, and for making the environment of the Help Centre and Help Desk so welcoming and fun to work in. As well, I’d like to thank all the analysts and members of other teams in CCS for their patience and support in answering my questions and assisting with problems that I encountered.</p>

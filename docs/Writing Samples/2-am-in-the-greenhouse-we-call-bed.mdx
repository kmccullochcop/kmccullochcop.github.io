<p>Lying on a bed of daisies<br/>
You are bleeding from your chest<br/>
Another hand reaches up<br/>
Sews another stitch<br/>
You are still bleeding<br/>
Somewhere, three old women laugh.</p>

<p>When you were a girl,<br/>
Did you carry love in your pockets?<br/>
Did you carry it somewhere easily found,<br/>
Easily stolen from?<br/>
Did you let love fall from your pockets like water?<br/>
Leaking out of your hands,<br/>
Your mouth,<br/>
Your eyes,<br/>
You did, didn't you?</p>

<p>Here is a symphony of limbs<br/>
Steam rises to meet cold air<br/>
Condensation forms on the skin that peeks out<br/>
Breasts, belly, knees.<br/>
Pink skin rising like islands from soapy water<br/>
Folded into the bath like a ragdoll<br/>
Balancing body over body<br/>
Collapsing limbs into each other<br/>
You have never felt more immense</p>


<p>Everything glows,<br/>
Neon roses at the end of a rain slick-street,<br/>
Standing in front of the 24 hour dry cleaners,<br/>
My heart beats, a kick to the ribs,<br/>
Your mouth is round and full and shaped like longing.<br/>
I would not mind if it was you who killed me.</p>

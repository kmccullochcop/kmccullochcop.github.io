<p float="right"><Indent/><i>Do you meet the forest in your dreams?</i> Yes. <i>Do you run naked beneath the
bright moon, breathless and cold?</i> Yes. <i>Do you bleed lust and breathe loyalty? </i>
Yes. <i>Do you know suffering?</i> Yes. <i>Joy?</i> Yes. <i>Are you a maiden?</i> Yes. <i>Do you
know love? Loss?</i> Yesâ€“yes.<br/>
<Indent/>Artemis steps down from her pedestal in the dark of night. <i>Welcome</i>. Under
sunlight she is frozen in the midst of a hunt. Under the full moon, she moves,
white light glancing off marble skin. She is a constant, unfailingly stone. Is
there love in a marble face? There is not blood. Can you trust a woman whose heart
does not pump her own blood? You can love a goddess. You can trust a woman. <i>Can
you trust a goddess who does not own her blood?</i> You are unsure. Nonetheless,
you will try. <br/>
<Indent/>Artemis is stone and power. Did you know this? Have you let your blood pool in
quartz courtyards? Have you let your heart fall from your chest in a granite
mausoleum? Let the sound of it echo off granite walls and marble faces? What is
the difference between dying in a stone room and loving a stone goddess?
<i>There is no difference. You know this.</i> You are terrified by this. <i>I am here
in all my marble glory. Open your arteries. Bleed.</i><br/>
<Indent/>Artemis of The Wildlands. The Wildlands. You know them. They are cold and empty.
They live in the pit of your stomach, in your ribcage, in your dreams. <i>The
Wildlands. You have lived here. You have lived here with me. You have hunted
here with me. You know me.</i> You love her dearly, but she can only be what she is.
She is stone, statue, huntress without a bow, woman without blood. <i>You can only
ever be what you are.</i><br/>
<Indent/><i>Is dawn approaching? Is Eos bleeding orange and pink across the sky?</i>
Loving is a costly adventure. Does Artemis know that you can only love in silver?
Maybe. Maybe not. She must return to her post. <i>You may leave as well. It will
be much more difficult. Selene will come again. Dawn will not last long.</i> <br/></p>

They will then, in small groups, practise identifying these elements for several new advertisements. Each group will share their findings to the class as a whole. \\n\\nIn their groups, students will then take on a scavenger hunt style activity. They will use tech to search for and find all the various types of advertisements as given to them in a scavenger-hunt-style list. They will need to identify the subject/audience/message for each of the ads found.\\n\\n**Timing:** 55 minutes\\n\\n### Closure: Exit Card\\nThe closure is what the instructor does to facilitate wrap-up at the end of the lesson - it is a quick review, to remind students what it was that they have learned (or should have learned) and allows you to see where the students are to assist you in planning for the next lesson. May also help students to think about their own learning (metacognition).\\n\\nBefore the end of the lesson, students will have some time to individually respond to a few questions:\\nWhat did they already know about advertising?

They will then have 2 minutes to follow the in-text links on the page, and see how far they can get from the original topic as possible. They will then share with the class what topic they ended on, and the path they took to get there. \\n**Timing:** 10 minutes\\n\\n### Development: Review & Practice\\nThe development provides experiences that guide and support students. Introduces content that is meaningful and relevant, challenges the students without frustrating them, actively engages the students, and involves a range of instructional approaches and activities. \\n\\nIn this lesson, students will review how information is cited/sourced in nonfiction texts, and how that can help with further research for a given topic. In small groups, they will practice finding external sources in a short sample non-fiction text (that they have seen & read in a prior class), and how to determine which of those sources are most relevant to the research they would need to do. The class will then take up what they found. \\n\\nStudents will then choose from one of 3 articles provided, and complete a graphic organizer which contains 3 sections: \\n- What they know and are wondering about the topic before reading\\n- A copy of the article as they have annotated it as they read\\n- What they are still wondering about, what they learned, and where they can go for more information on the topic.\\n\\n**Timing:** 45 minutes\\n\\n### Closure: Peer-Sharing\\nThe closure is what the instructor does to facilitate wrap-up at the end of the lesson - it is a quick review, to remind students what it was that they have learned (or should have learned) and allows you to see where the students are to assist you in planning for the next lesson. May also help students to think about their own learning (metacognition).\\n\\nIn this lesson, students will gather in small groups based on which article they chose, and share what they filled out in the third section of the graphic organizer. Students will then hand in the graphic organizer. \\n\\n**Timing:** 20 minutes\\n\\n## Assessment Strategies\\nAssessment AS Learning: students will share and review each other\'s ability to find relevant external sources within non-fiction texts.\\n\\n## Documents & Resources\\n- [Lesson Slides](/ENG4C_ResearchLP_Slides.pdf)\\n- [Graphic Organizer](/ENG4C_ResearchLP_Organizer.pdf)\\n- [Sample Article 1 (*If Ticketmaster Botches Beyonce \'Renaissance\'...*)](/ENG4C_ResearchLP_Article1.pdf)\\n- [Sample Article 2 (*On the Money*)](/ENG4C_ResearchLP_Article2.pdf)\\n- [Sample Article 3 (*The NotSo-Social Network*)](/ENG4C_ResearchLP_Article3.pdf)"},{"id":"/2023/02/28/seniorenglishreflection","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/02/28/seniorenglishreflection","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-28-seniorenglishreflection.md","title":"Reflections on Teaching Senior English","description":"Draft conceptual framework","date":"2023-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"teaching-philosophy","permalink":"/blog/tags/teaching-philosophy"}],"readingTime":4.345,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kathleen McCulloch-Cop","imageURL":"/img/profilePic.png","key":"katie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Reflections on Teaching Senior English","description":"Draft conceptual framework","authors":"katie","tags":["teaching-philosophy"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"ENG4C Active Reading for Research Lesson Plan ","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/28/researchlessonplan"},"nextItem":{"title":"Learning Blog - Reaching All Students","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/03/reachingallstudents"}},"content":"The act of teaching historically and traditionally, in Western settings, is synonymous with sharing expertise, with being a keeper of knowledge and therefore always the speaker, never asking questions without knowing the answer. As we move into inclusive and culturally-responsive pedagogy, that idea is being dismantled, and the \x3c!--truncate--\x3eposition of a teacher as a person who makes mistakes, who is not the authority on any subject, let alone the one they are teaching, is being constructed. As is posited in \u2018Read, Listen, Tell\u2019, \u201cWe do not read from a so-called neutral, omniscient perspective from which we can under- stand everything\u201d (pg 4), and neither do we teach \u2014 I cannot, as a white woman living on unneeded territory, pretend that I may ever teach any subject, particularly one such as FNMI Studies, without the lens of living and working as a colonizer, with all the privileges that I am afforded with that position. What I can do is be aware of my own positionality, and ask those questions that \u201cRead, Listen, Tell\u201d offers: \u201cWho am I, how have my experiences shaped what I know, and what do I need to learn?\u201d (Pg 4). Of course, the answers to those questions are not and cannot be static: my personal context, as it relates to my position as a teacher, will not be the same between any two texts. If I were to assume this, I would be at risk of narrowing what I may learn. To singularly and completely define any one thing is to exclude the potential that it holds and to reduce the capabilities it has; this is an idea that is repeated in \u201cRead, Listen, Tell\u201d and \u201cWhy Indigenous Literature Matters\u201d: McCall et. all refuse to offer \u201ca stable definition of what Indigenous literatures \u201care,\u201d\u201d as this would offer \u201cdefinitions that risk excluding and silencing voices\u201d  (pg 3), while Justice, again and again, asks us to expand our definitions as we approach what Indigenous literature is. While recognizing that no one definition may encompass all facets of the thing it tries to define\u2014and more often than not, limits and excludes key pieces\u2014is an important idea to keep in mind in all aspects of teaching, it is particularly critical when approaching Indigenous literatures and ways of knowledge. Justice remarks: \u201cnot all things are meant for all people\u201d. I am not meant to understand the breadth of Indigenous cultures, I do not have the right to all of the knowledge and stories that an Indigenous elder may hold.  I can learn as much as I am able, and part of that includes learning that there are some things that I am not entitled to, that I may wonder at. I cannot ever be the foremost expert, nor should I expect to be.\\n\\nAs I navigate through Indigenous literatures, and the ways that knowledge is kept or shared depending on the positionality of the keeper and the reader, I reflect on how story changes too. Questions come to mind, such as: What do we know to be true? What stories have we been told and regarded as fiction, rather than truth? How do we navigate the past, our history (as people, as a country, as colonizers) while trying to balance those binaries of fact and fiction, history and story? While reading The Marrow Thieves, the ground is shifting constantly for the characters: they have built their understanding of the world based on the (hi)story they know to be \u2018true\u2019, but that story is told in pieces or winds itself around the facts, burying truth in fiction. When new details come to light, the ground shifts again, and we (along with the characters) have to reckon with and adapt to the new light that has been shed on the world they thought they knew. Whether those details are small, intimate truths, major events, or new chapters of stories we thought we knew, they change what we know to be fact, and what we know to be fiction, drawing new lines all the time. This is reflected in our world too: what I thought I knew about residential schools, and considered to be a full and true history, changed upon the discovery of mass graves in the summer of 2021. I find myself tracking mirrors of these changes, and mirrors of their reactions, in my own life. This text is allowing me a point of inquiry into how we see truth, how we understand fiction, and how history and story both inform our view of the world, and how that view changes with every new detail and every new story we are presented with. \\n\\nThroughout, there are major themes of shifting perspectives. I am grappling with the understanding that what is in these works of fiction very closely mirrors our history as a country founded on colonialism and genocide. The binaries I am inspecting are not as dichotomous as we\u2019d like to imagine they are: fact is often woven into fiction, and fiction can be presented as fact; but the question then remains, how do we engage with this text (with any text really) when we know for some, it will be truth, and for others, it will simply be a story?"},{"id":"/2022/12/03/reachingallstudents","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/12/03/reachingallstudents","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-03-reachingallstudents.md","title":"Learning Blog - Reaching All Students","description":"learning blog post","date":"2022-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"teaching-philosophy","permalink":"/blog/tags/teaching-philosophy"}],"readingTime":4.11,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kathleen McCulloch-Cop","imageURL":"/img/profilePic.png","key":"katie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Learning Blog - Reaching All Students","description":"learning blog post","authors":"katie","tags":["teaching-philosophy"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Reflections on Teaching Senior English","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/28/seniorenglishreflection"},"nextItem":{"title":"Learning Blog - Literacy as a Resource","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/02/literacyasresource"}},"content":"In an ideal world, all students would have the necessary skills and perform at the standards for their level. English teachers would be able to select one method of instruction, trusting that they would reach every student, and enable them to engage with the tasks and perform their learning. However, this is not the case. Every student has a unique set of skills \x3c!--truncate--\x3eperformed at varying levels, and they will not all be engaged with or even capable of the tasks set before them. This presents a challenge for all subjects, but particularly in English classrooms, where conversation and discussion are large parts of fostering the critical thinking skills necessary for developing text analysis abilities, and connecting ideas and responding to others is critical for fostering reading comprehension skills. Some level of commonality is required for students to be able to work together, respond to each other\u2019s ideas, and reflect on different perspectives of the same situation. Because of this, creating individual tasks or assigning different content to each student can lead to stagnation in learning, but generalised and uniform instruction will only reach so many students, leaving the rest out of these important conversations and activities. \\n\\n\\nSo how do we reach every student on their level, while practising differentiated instruction and still creating that common ground on which students can connect with each other\u2019s work? There are a lot of tactics, and as difficult as it can be to put into practice in English classrooms, the subject also lends itself quite well to this problem. \\n\\nLiterature circles are not only fantastic opportunities for practising collaborative group work and involving many kinds of texts in the classroom. They also allow for many different tasks centred on common content while involving different skill areas and levels, so that students can do work they are capable of, and still relate and respond to their peers. More than that, it facilitates the ability to use many texts at once, so all students can work with a text that they will be able to comprehend, and others are not bored or intimidated by the content they work with. Each group works with a text tailored (as much as is reasonably possible) for their skills and interests, and can take on roles within their group that will engage their interests and provide them with a point of entry into the conversation with their other members. That common ground is still available to students \u2013 they are able to hear from their peers, connect those ideas the a text they are familiar with, and respond in turn. When linked text sets are used, and the whole class is working in different lit circles on texts that relate to each other, even more connections are possible. Students can find commonalities between texts, ideas, and questions, and have a basis for connection and idea-building, without the skill level demanded by the content standing in the way of larger discussions. They can also see how their ideas and perspectives relate to a larger collection of work, allowing them to develop even more connections to and from their text, and founding a greater base for them to draw understanding and build ideas from, and still be working at a level appropriate for them. \\n\\nThanks to the broad umbrella of content that falls under the discipline of English, the actual content that may be used can also facilitate reaching every student while still providing general lessons. Students may struggle with classic literature, and that\u2019s just fine, because reading comprehension and text analysis is still present in YA novels, graphic novels, short stories, poetry, and even magazines. Other texts that aren\u2019t prose, like articles, biographies, poetry, informational brochures, and instructional texts can similarly be delivered on a variety of levels and can cover any content area possible. Essay writing may not come naturally to most students \u2013 but written expression and idea communication can be done with creative fiction assignments, storyboarding activities, letter-writing, daily journaling, summarising tasks, and concept maps. Because language is used in almost every aspect of our lives, there is practically no limit on what constitutes content in an English classroom, meaning that ideas like convention, form, and style can be discussed across any number of texts, allowing for students to engage with content that suits them as people and as appropriate for their skill level as learners, while still being able to relate their work to their peers and draw on conversations and common concepts in order to further their understanding. \\n\\nWhile differentiating instruction and content for students can be intimidating, and certainly requires a delicate balance, it is essential for ensuring that students are engaged and learning in every classroom. While an English classroom necessitate some form of common ground in order to develop essential skills, the subject is thankfully flexible enough to accommodate for this in a large number of ways, from delivery methods to content to tasks."},{"id":"/2022/12/02/literacyasresource","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/12/02/literacyasresource","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-02-literacyasresource.md","title":"Learning Blog - Literacy as a Resource","description":"learning blog post","date":"2022-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"teaching-philosophy","permalink":"/blog/tags/teaching-philosophy"}],"readingTime":3.285,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kathleen McCulloch-Cop","imageURL":"/img/profilePic.png","key":"katie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Learning Blog - Literacy as a Resource","description":"learning blog post","authors":"katie","tags":["teaching-philosophy"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Learning Blog - Reaching All Students","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/03/reachingallstudents"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome!","permalink":"/blog/welcome-docusaurus-v2"}},"content":"In Canadian schools, English and Language Arts are at the core of skill development in nearly every classroom. Math, science, history, technology, business, arts: all of these require foundations in vocabulary procurement, comprehension of instructions, and information processing. However, because so often English class is associated with reading fiction and essay writing, it becomes siloed \x3c!--truncate--\x3ein students\u2019 minds. The Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test aims to measure \u201cwhether students are meeting the minimum standard for literacy across all subjects\u201d but still focuses on reading texts and writing . The ways in which literacy is applied in every subject is considered to be implicit. Students, particularly those who struggle with reading and writing, are expected to make the connection between their literacy skills and their abilities in other disciplines on their own. Often, students shrug at English classes, ask why they need to know the information, complain about how they don\u2019t like reading anyways, so who cares if they\u2019re good at it? They don\u2019t see how it impacts their ability to create a successful resume, communicate with colleagues or supervisors, or process information that is not prose. As educators, we tend to forget or deprioritize this fact, when it should be at the forefront of a successful English classroom.\\n\\nWhat tends to add to the isolation of English as a discipline is its content. As English teachers, we are predisposed to love the written word: books and stories are interesting and engaging, something that we not only love to study, but love to study with others, sharing thoughts and opinions, discussing what was interesting or surprising, dissecting the ways the story was crafted. Not every student feels the same \u2013 in fact, many students very strongly disagree with that view. Books are boring, often dealing with old and outdated ideas or settings. Having to not only read, but talk about (or god forbid, write about) narrative texts is torturous and seems pointless. What relevance does it have to their lives? How is reading books going to prepare them for the real world past grade 12 when they don\u2019t even read outside of school? Of course, students are always reading, as both our digital and physical lives are saturated in text and written language. But the act of reading is not associated with scrolling social media or messaging with friends, due in part to the way English has traditionally been taught. When students who have gone through classes with \u2018silent reading time\u2019 meaning they need to physically hold a book and follow a story in their head, there tends to be no other definition of reading. If that action is the sole definition of reading, and literacy skills are equated to \u2018reading skills\u2019, then what does literacy matter outside of the English classroom? How does it apply to their real lives?\\n\\nWhen this is the way English is taught and discussed, that\u2019s a fair question. But when English classes and teachers make explicit the connections between the real world and the skills students are learning, suddenly, students can see how important English class is. When we step outside of the canon and traditional narrative texts, and focus on unconventional content, we can show students just how essential literacy is. Resumes, instructional guides, summary texts, professional communication; these are all texts that do not fall under the traditional concept of English class content, but are essential in a workplace. Skills like media literacy, processing, paraphrasing, researching, drawing inferences, and making connections all require strong foundations in reading comprehension and written expression, and can be fostered in many ways that do not follow traditional English classroom methods. Drawing on real-world examples, applying activities to students\u2019 everyday lives, and showing them just how many opportunities become available for them with the procurement of these skills demonstrates to them how an English classroom prepares them for excellence in all areas of their lives, and we need to take care to prioritise this fact."},{"id":"welcome-docusaurus-v2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome-docusaurus-v2","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-28-hello.md","title":"Welcome!","description":"First blog post.","date":"2022-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 28, 2022","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"}],"readingTime":0.045,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kathleen McCulloch-Cop","imageURL":"/img/profilePic.png","key":"katie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome!","description":"First blog post.","slug":"welcome-docusaurus-v2","authors":"katie","tags":["hello"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Learning Blog - Literacy as a Resource","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/02/literacyasresource"}},"content":"Welcome to this blog!

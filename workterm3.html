          <h2>About LINCS</h2>
          <p>Working as a part of LINCS (Linked Infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship) for this work term opened my eyes to the possibilities that Digital Humanities and Linked Open Data (LOD) create. I learned about the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee’s model for 5-star LOD, and the many standards that exist in order to implement these concepts. My main focus was researching and consolidating usability evaluations on different tools that made up the process of creating LOD, or converting existing data to be LOD. This included reading, writing, and rewriting documentation for tools that were meant for network visualization, data conversion, data reconciliation, and/or data querying. I also worked with other projects that were in conjunction with or fell under LINCS, presenting information about more efficient workflows they could use for gathering data, reviews to their documentation, or plans for cleaning up the project pipelines. I was also able to make direct contributions to the databases of other projects, namely Orlando and CWRC (Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory).

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>My first learning goal was to improve my skills in documentation, specifically in regards to documenting my workflows for different aspects of my work. Especially in a co-op position where the person filling the role is constantly changing, it can be so important to create records of what worked or didn’t work to better inform the person following you in the role. In this position, this skill was also needed as I would present different workflows that I had learned, honed, and adjusted to be most efficient, so that other projects under LINCS could use those in their own work.</p>
                  <p>Throughout this term, I was constantly documenting the steps I took and any problems I ran into, as well as how I fixed them, so that by the time it became necessary for me to present these to others, they were filled with the most relevant details, and compiled in a way that was easy to follow and use as a reference.

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>Another learning goal for this term was to improve my knowledge of UI/UX evaluation methods and tools. As my position was User Experience Developer, I needed to not only understand different methods and approaches to UX evaluation, as well as why one would use the many tools that are available, but I needed to be able actually put them into practice for my work in researching software and interfaces and evaluating them for use in with LINCS. </p>
                  <p>I researched many different methods, reading countless scholarly articles detailing different concepts relating to usability testing (flow, serendipity, different survey techniques). I also participated in user testing, getting a feel for how to conduct user testing and set up tasks for users to test from the point of view of the user, which was invaluable. Using all this knowledge, I was actually able to conduct a heuristic evaluation on a specific interface. </p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>Another learning goal for this work term was to improve my use of skills from both my technical and my humanities studies. As I study both Software Engineering and English and Literature, I have a wide range of skills pertaining to each. Due to the unique nature of this position, I needed to utilize both of these backgrounds in conjunction with each other to complete tasks.</p>
                  <p>This meant that while I needed to evaluate the capabilities of an interface from a technical standpoint, while evaluating usability I needed to review documentation from the standpoint of a writer, and to think about how the end-user (in this case, humanities researchers) would want to use it and if the tool was able to perform in that way. I also needed to communicate technical concepts to people who may not have much technical experience, meaning that I had to then approach the information and use my skills from my English studies to translate the information.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>My final learning goal was one that related more so to the circumstances of the work term. As the work term was May to August of 2020, I was working entirely from home to stay safe amidst a global pandemic. Because I was not in an office everyday with a supervisor in the same room and in-person meetings or reminders, I wanted to be sure that working from home didn’t impact the work I was able to do, and that I kept on top of my tasks in order to finish them according to timelines I set for myself.</p>
                  <p>I kept myself accountable with tracking my time spent completing tasks in order to accurately estimate timelines for other tasks, and keeping a log of what was highest priority and when each task was needed by. I found that between my own work to keep track of tasks, stand-up Zoom meetings every morning, and a document regularly updated with my tasks and my notes on what I was able to complete and any notes on issues, I not only had lots of support from my supervisors, but the transition to working from home did not end up being a problem.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This co-op work term, though unconventional, was an incredible learning experience, and allowed for me to grow my skills across different domains. I found out so much about the different paths and areas of research that the Digital Humanities make possible, and had a great time doing it!</p>

        <div class="row co-op-section" id="acknowledgements">
          <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
          <p>I want to thank my supervisors, Alliya, Susan, and Kim for all their support throughout this co-op term, not only with the work itself but with the challenges that came with working from home. As well, I want to thank the other students, and everyone else working for LINCS and Orlando across North America this summer for creating a great work community even though we couldn’t meet in person!</p>

          <h2>About Nokia</h2>
          <p>Nokia is a globally recognizable name in telecommunications and information technology, based out of Finland. For this co-op work term, I had the privilege of working remotely for Nokia's Ottawa office, in the Network Services Platform (NSP) Test group under the Network Infrastructure IP Networks division. The NSP is an enterprise software that equips service providers with a suite of applications to help automate and manage IP and optical networks. In my role for this work term, I was focused on writing and debugging scripts used internally for automated testing of the NSP and various features, as well as upgrading the NSP as a whole. I am very grateful to have gained valuable, foundational experience using Selenium WebDriver, regression testing, writing and debugging automated test and task automation scripts, and using Docker containers with Kubernetes pods and Helm charts to configure and deploy applications

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>My first learning goal for this work term was to improve my capabilities in self-directed learning and wayfinding among new information structures. Taking on a new role, especially in a remote-work situation, requires a degree of self-directed learning and navigation through unfamiliar information systems regardless of the position. This role in particular had many aspects that I knew would require a great degree of learning on my part, and so I knew it would be critical that I be able to navigate the information structures and be able to use all resources that were available to me in order to rise to any challenges I encountered. </p>
                  <p>These resources included expansive internal documentation and learning centres, the expertise and experience of my fellow team members, various external documentation centres created for client use, and the vast amounts of information available externally. I focused on becoming comfortable not only navigating all these information centres, but understanding when and how to access each one, and which would be the best fit for the information I was looking for. Now at the end of this work term, I feel I've successfully achieved this goal, and gathered valuable experience in wayfinding among immense information systems.

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>Another learning goal for this work term was to focus on how I can best and most effectively bring together my previously developed skills in order to accomplish work that I was presented with and solve problems that I encountered. This position was the first of its kind that I had experienced, as much of my previous work terms did not involve tasks that focused on programming and writing automation testing, and I did not have professional experience writing automation testing. I knew that I would be presented with tasks that would not be familiar to me, and I resolved to develop my abilities to be able to use my full range of skills to understand, unpack, and solve these problems.</p>
                  <p>Throughout my work term I used skills I had developed from previous work terms, and those I was still working on during this work term, in order to work through and solve tasks that came my way that I was not familiar with. These skills included workflow documentation, debugging, wayfinding, communication, and white-box testing, and I can now say that I am very confident in my ability to use a wide variety of skills in order to effectively problem solve.  </p>

                  <p>My final learning goal for this work term was to improve my skills in writing and debugging automation testing and test suites. This was the focus of this position, and as such, I set out to learn as much as I could about the common practices, tools, executions, and use cases in order to be more knowledgeable about creation, implementation, and utilization of automation testing in the industry. </p>
                  <p>I learned a lot about automation testing and test suite creation, and feel very confident in my understanding of the field. I was able to not just recognize best practices in the domain, but to debug and fix failing tests and test suites according to the standards and best practices, as well as creating a test suite from scratch in order to test a specific feature on the platform ahead of a release. </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This work term was an incredibly valuable one. I learned so much in my time there, gaining experience in a number of areas ranging from specific tools, programming languages, transferable skills, and industry standards and practices.  I'm very grateful for the experience and the knowledge that I gained while at Nokia. </p>

          <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
          <p>I'd like to thank my team members for their immense support as I learned and familiarized myself with the platform and the various tools I used, as well as for being incredibly welcoming, particularly during a remote work situation which can make joining a new organization difficult. I'd also like to thank my manager Yanik for his support and guidance throughout this work term, and for providing me with a fantastic opportunity to learn and develop my skills in computing. </p>

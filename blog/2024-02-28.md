Students 4 Change was a research project undertaken in my second year of teacher's college, for the PED 4220 *Enacting g Collaborative Inquiry in Professional Practice* course. Under the supervision of my associate teacher as well as my practicum advisor Linda Radford, I facilitated and aided in students organizing initiatives to create change within their own communities. <!--truncate--> For this instance of the Students 4 Change program, the students I was supervising and helping coordinate chose to find ways to reach out to and support children, youth, and families experiencing the effects of school absences caused by long-term hospital stays or lengthy travel from remote communities to access healthcare at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO).

The full report on this project can be found [here](/Students4ChangeReport.pdf).

This unit plan was developed in February/March 2023, as part of the course *PED 4177 - Teaching English at the Senior Division*, by myself, William Peddle, and Kate Gray, using the template created by Linda Radford and Robert Ballantyne. 

It was developed according to the most recent version of the curriculum *[NBE3U - English: Understanding Contemporary First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit Voices](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/secondary-first-nations-metis-and-inuit-studies/courses/nbe3u)*.


The unit plan itself, *Positioning Story: Exploring Characterization, Thematics, Structure & Style* can be viewed [here](/NBE3U_UnitPlan.pdf).

## Instructions
Welcome to the world of advertising! Madison Avenue is populated with high-rise buildings filled with advertising agencies, where everyday, people pitch advertising campaigns, sketch print advertisements, and write ‘copy’ (advertising scripts/slogans). You want to work there (doesn’t everyone?), but first, you have to pitch an ad campaign so the agency can get an idea of what you’ll bring to the table.

Don’t worry – the agency knows you’re working on your own, and that this is just a pitch. They only ask for **between 3 - 5 advertisements (of at least 2 different formats) with a specific subject, audience, and message.** Your audience and message need to make sense for the subject you choose.

Subjects can be one of :
- Product (something you can physically buy and own)
- Service (non-physical things, for example insurance, healthcare, or tutoring)
- Communication (an idea, message, or announcement)
- 
Once you’ve made those decisions, you need to plan the details of your campaign. What **ad formats** make sense for your subject, audience, and message? What **context** makes sense for these ads?

Finally, you will pitch your campaign – **a 3 minute or less presentation where you tell us about your subject, audience, and message, your advertisements, and why the formats and contexts you chose suit them.**

Available formats:
| Format | 1 advertisment = |
|--|--|
| Tiktok video | 15 seconds of video |
| Instagram story post | 2 (different) image stories OR 1 (15 second) video story |
| Instagram posts | 2 (different) images AND associated captions |

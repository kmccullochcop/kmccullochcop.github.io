## Overview
The follow up to an intro lesson plan for an advertising unit -- going more in-depth with the components of an advertisement, and some of the ways that advertisements work. Designed for a Grade 12 English College Preparation classroom, within a 75 minute period. 
Note: while this lesson is designed to be completed within one 75 minute period, it may be beneficial for students to have work periods between each lesson, in order to work on/complete the tasks and review the information, as well as to ensure that students are not overwhelmed with information or moving at a pace that is not conducive for full comprehension.

**Guiding Question:** *How do ads work?*

## Lesson Execution
### Hook: Review
A hook focuses attention on the learning intention to come, provides a framework for the learning, and examples/analogies for understanding, and promotes interest and involvement and bridges from past lesson(s)/learning or prior knowledge.

In this lesson, students will very briefly review the core pieces of an advertisement, as they learned in part 1. 

**Timing:** 5 minutes

### Development: Techniques + Components, Concept Maps
The development provides experiences that guide and support students. Introduces content that is meaningful and relevant, challenges the students without frustrating them, actively engages the students, and involves a range of instructional approaches and activities. 

In this lesson, students will  take a look at the core techniques advertisements (emotion, logic, credibility) and components of ad (context, form, design) and examples of how to identify these. 

In small groups, students will then choose an advertisement from a given list, and create concept maps covering the subject, audience, message, techniques used, context, from, and design elements of the advertisements. 

**Timing:** 45 minutes

### Closure: Presentations
The closure is what the instructor does to facilitate wrap-up at the end of the lesson - it is a quick review, to remind students what it was that they have learned (or should have learned) and allows you to see where the students are to assist you in planning for the next lesson. May also help students to think about their own learning (metacognition).

Before the end of the lesson, students will, in their groups, present their  chosen advertisements and the concept maps they created to the class.

**Timing:** 25 minutes

## Assessment Strategies
Assessment FOR Learning: the teacher will collect and review the concept maps in order to see where students are at, what they know, and what they need more time on.

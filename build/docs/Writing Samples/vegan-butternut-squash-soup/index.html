Six floors. Enough to leave me panting quietly in the hallway. The canvas straps cut into my arms, leaving behind stark red stripes even after I drop them on the floor. They hit the ground with a thud, and the butternut squash rolls out towards the stairs. Sighing, I reach over and scoop it up. I turn back to my apartment door, patting down each pocket looking for my keys, like I’m a middle aged man who’s lost his wallet. I used to always know where my keys were. I miss that. The door squeaks as it opens, and I make yet another mental note to fix that.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I haul one bag back over my shoulder, too fast. That was a mistake—I feel dizzy, like I’m about to throw up, and it takes a few deep breaths before my eyes can focus on the other, heavier bag, still sitting on the floor. I’m so tired. I use my foot to nudge the second bag through the door, but instead, it topples over, sending my groceries careening across the apartment floor. Cans of vegetable broth race against beets and potatoes to every corner of the apartment. At least the corners aren’t far. Sometimes a tiny apartment has its perks.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Turning to close the door, I catch my reflection in the mirror above the credenza. Strands of dry, damaged hair fall at every angle, some just barely clinging to the top knot I did this morning. I thought it might make me look like Alexa Chung, as well as hide the fact that it’s been too long since I’ve last showered. Neither was accomplished. My shirt is cross-buttoned, and in the afternoon light it’s clear that my last-resort bra’s leopard-pink pattern is clearly visible beneath the white cotton. Holding the butternut squash to my chest, I look almost maternal, a messed-up Madonna and Child. Pathetic. If Dan knew that I looked like this, let alone looked like this at work, he’d have a fit. But if Dan were still here, he would have said something before I left. Better yet, if Dan were here, I wouldn’t have looked like this in the first place. But there’s no use in thinking about that.</p><p>Putting away the groceries takes longer than I want. Longer than it should have. My whole body hurts. I need to write. My editor has told me that I’ve reached my limit on extensions for what should have been “a super easy breezy piece!” But she’s a bitch, and she looks like a praying mantis, just all limbs. She doesn’t get to talk to me about ‘easy.’ I collapse into the couch, and it drains all remaining energy out of me. My hair finally gives up and falls to my collarbone, feeling simultaneously oily and dry against my skin. This is pathetic.</p><p>I know what Dan would say if he were here. “Pull yourself together. Tomorrow’s a new day. There’s a million people who would kill to be in your position. Wash your face and keep going.” He was always ready with a million platitudes, well-equipped to fend off any feelings of self-pity. The kind of sayings he and his co-workers yell at each other all day across the stock market floor to keep each other from flinging themselves out of their offices’ floor to ceiling windows.</p><p>Slumping farther down, I set my feet on the coffee table. A sharp, angry voice cracks the silence. “Sit up. You’re not pretty when you slouch.” Snapping out of my end-of-day stupor, I sit straight up, roll my shoulders back. My mother’s voice doesn’t often cross my mind. I try not to let it. But it’s been harder to do that lately. It’s still a shock every time, even if it’s happening increasingly more often. I’d much rather hear Dan’s stupid platitudes than my mother’s criticisms.</p><p>I pull my feet up onto the couch and tuck my knees into my chest, holding eye contact with the chipped and broken typewriter. Today took everything out of me. It’s been a bad week—a bad year, really. I struggle to keep my eyes open. A quick nap couldn’t hurt. Twenty minutes, and then I’ll write the damn article.</p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="9-zendaya-sneaking-some-sweet-potato-fries">#9: Zendaya Sneaking Some Sweet Potato Fries<a class="hash-link" href="#9-zendaya-sneaking-some-sweet-potato-fries" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->If you don’t love Zendaya, then you’re a liar. She’s America’s sweetheart. She’s the golden girl of modern cinema. She’s the most effervescent young celeb we’ve got. And here she is, caught in the light of the paparazzi camera, snacking on some fries. So cute. <br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->I love fries. There’s nothing quite like eating cold sweet-potato fries at midnight—grease sticking to your lips and coating your tongue, shovelling them into your mouth so fast you can barely taste the salt. Right? And you do this because you’re starving, because you barely ate at the restaurant, because you knew your date wouldn’t want to fuck you if he thought you were a pig, because he said when he picked you up how slim you looked. But then, when he did fuck you, it didn’t last long, and you just sort of lay there again, waiting for him to finish. And then, you waited longer, nauseous from the pressure of his body on yours, thinking about how much better it would have been to have just eaten the sweet potato fries, praying for him to just get up and leave so you could sneak to the kitchen and get your takeout box. So you could stand in the damn-near holy light of the refrigerator and moan into a mouthful of half-eaten sweet potato.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->But we’ve all been there. I’ve been there. I know you’ve been there. I bet Zendaya’s never been there. But she’s still young. I’m not young anymore. I’m at the age where I’ve stopped dating frat boys who think it’s hot when you pig out on food. Instead, I’m dating men who sweat too much and tell you to your face how many miles you’d have to run before you burned off the fries. But that’s growing up.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->My mother taught me that. She taught me that girlhood was something with sharp edges, to never get comfortable in it, because it never lasts, and when the curtain comes down on the whole circus you’re left covered in glitter, old and tired, muffin-topping out of your costume.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Enjoy it, Zendaya. Enjoy being young and fun and able to eat the fries while they’re still warm. We’re all very jealous. But don’t worry. You’ll get here one day. We all do.<br></p></blockquote><hr><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I wake in the dark. Shit. Checking my phone, that’s three hours, wasted. Three hours I needed to get my article done for tomorrow if I wanted to go out with Mallory tonight. Mallory, who texted me an hour ago, “Lydia, r we still hitting Barro’s tn @ 9?”</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>“Srry!!!!” I type, “Things w/ work r crazy busy again, have to stay in and write!!!” Honestly, I feel relieved. Cancelling plans feels like that headrush after the seventh tequila shot. That perfect, iridescent moment. Your body is a tingly cloud, you’re shitfaced enough to stop thinking about real life, and you haven&#x27;t yet drunk-dialed your ex with your head in the toilet.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Actually, a drink wouldn’t be a bad idea right now. That’ll probably help the writing process. If I can loosen up, stop being so uptight, I can probably finish it in a couple of hours. There’s rosé in the fridge, but I don’t feel like I’m fun enough for rosé right now. I thought I had white wine, but from the look of the recycling bin, I finished that last night. The bottle of gin sits in the freezer, looming over a plastic baggie of frozen lemon quarters. I could have gin right now. Gin is a good writer’s drink. Isn’t that what Fitzgerald drank, gin? And he was as good at writing as he was at drinking. More than that, gin is a good diet drink. Bracing myself against the first sip, I glance at the typewriter. It sits there dumb, staring back. The broken keys stick out, ugly, like crooked teeth or ragged nails. Something inside of the typewriter plinks and for a moment, I’m sitting in my mother’s living room, listening to her tap her ring against the side of her glass. But that’s not where I am. I’m in my own apartment, with my own drink, watching the typewriter. The gin is cold, the lemon tart. Refreshing. I shake my head and pull my hair back up, away from my face and out of my eyes.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I need to eat something before I write anything. I’m starving, I haven’t eaten since … since I don’t know when. It doesn’t matter. I need to eat, now, before I can write the article. I drag my body off the couch and pull open the fridge. All I want right now is something savory and easy. Standing there, with the cool air almost sensual against my face, and the old lightbulb burning golden in the small space, I let my eyes unfocus, allowing myself a moment to imagine the perfect meal. A chicken breast, the skin left on, the bone still in, pan-fried in salted butter and olive oil and lemon juice, topped with rosemary, maybe there’s some pancetta and garlic cloves in the pan too. I can smell it, the lemon and garlic filling the apartment, can hear the skin crisping in the pan, the flavour melting out of the bone. That’s enough. I focus on the shelves of root vegetables and tofu staring back at me. Beets, carrots, potatoes, and broccoli roll around the bottom drawers. Sometimes I really hate this vegan thing. But I’m so good at it. I’m always committed to it in the grocery store, so proud to present my purchases to the older lady at the cash register. I feel pious, enviable, I relish in the stares from other customers as they look into their own baskets and count how many of their cravings they gave in to.</p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="7-kim-kardashian-west-showing-off-vegan-tacos-on-ig-live">#7: Kim Kardashian-West Showing Off Vegan Tacos on IG Live<a class="hash-link" href="#7-kim-kardashian-west-showing-off-vegan-tacos-on-ig-live" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Remember when Kim benevolently took us on an Instagram tour of all of her pantries and fridges and different kitchens? We can’t thank her enough for showing us how she lives. She’s so #GirlBossGoals. Anyways, while she was showing us how we can all aspire to live, she also showed us her vegan tacos that she was making her family for dinner that night! As a vegan myself, you know that I instantly flipped my shit. KKW has the best body in the business, so if she’s a vegan, then I’m like one step closer to getting that break-the-internet booty! But I’m just vegan cause I’m trying not to break my couch, LOL. <br></p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>When I first went vegan, my mother said it would be good for me, that maybe I’d finally lose my baby weight. I was 23. My mother wasn’t vegan, but she tried not to eat meat, so I come by it pretty naturally. I mean, my mother tried not to eat anything, in that sort of ‘single mother desperate to reclaim her body after childbirth’ sort of way. She’d always tell me she expected me to be sixty pounds when I was born, given the amount of weight she’d put on during pregnancy. Veganism must be Ms. Kardashian-West’s attempt at the same thing, right? She’s had four kids, so adhering to a strict diet has got to be in pursuit of a fat ass and a flat stomach. Nobody goes vegan and still wears leather if it’s really about the animals, right? And it can’t be for the climate, she’s got a house that requires professionals to fly in from Europe to buff the floors. But don’t worry Kim. I see you. I hold space for you. We’re in this together. We’re skinny vegans for life! <br><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Honestly, we should be proud of ourselves. We have no altruistic reasoning for this diet, no saviour complex driving us. It’s entirely self-motivated. Other people just can’t understand the amount of self-control that that takes. So to you, Kim, congrats for being able to stick to it. We can all only aspire to be so in control of our bodies. So in control of ourselves.<br></blockquote><hr><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>From the bottom shelf, the butternut squash catches my eye. I can make soup. It’ll take a long time, sure, but I can get some work done while I wait. I start preheating the oven, and pull the squash onto the counter. It sits there, massive in the small space. A huge, phallic vegetable. I hate it, I hate this part of butternut squash soup, where there’s this massive penis-esque gourd on my counter, sitting and waiting for me to hack into it. That’s why Dan used to do this part, and I’d do everything else. Except now it’s just me, doing it all.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I didn’t even like butternut squash until Dan. I hated the look of the vegetable and refused to purchase it on principle. But he loves it. He used to scoop the flesh right from the skin, fresh from the oven, not caring if he burnt his fingers, eating it practically plain. He made roasted butternut squash mac and cheese for dinner on our third date and didn’t tell me what it was until I’d practically licked the bowl clean, it was so good. That’s when I knew I loved him. So I learned how to make butternut squash soup, like his mom used to do for him, for our sixth month anniversary. Except that I hadn’t been able to get started, struggling to split the thing in two, and he’d had to help me out. It was one of our favourite dinners. I’m determined to keep it as one of mine. I won’t let it be ruined just because we are.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I cleave into the squash, splitting the flesh of it on the cutting board. Scooping the seeds out, I’m careful to keep as much of the vegetable intact as possible. I leave the skin on and flip the two sides onto a baking tray, where I practically drown them in olive oil. Coarse sea salt is next, followed by fresh pepper. By the time I’m done, the oven’s preheated, and I slip them into the centre, set a timer for forty-five minutes. It takes a long time, but it’s worth it. This soup feels like a home and smells like love and it’s wonderful, even if it begins in the absolute worst way. Maybe that’s like... a metaphor for life?</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Ew. No publishing company wants me to draw the parallels between phallic gourds and the meaning of life. I pull my bag from where I’d dumped it earlier, and ignoring the kitchen table, I slide back onto the couch, setting my gin down beside the typewriter. Opening my laptop, the empty document is still there, waiting, watching me blankly … is that anything? Anything I can jot down for my memoir? Probably not. It never is.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I’m kidding myself when I say I have to write an article for work. It’s barely an article, barely even prose, it’s just a listicle. My editor asked for “something about female celebrities and food, but make it like, deep kind of, give us more than just another ‘OMG how fun is this.’ Show us what this says about these women.” I asked her why women in particular. Her answer felt like a slap, harsh and sudden across my cheek. “Because no one cares about what men eat.” But she’s right.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>So far I’ve written “Top Ten Times Celebrities Ate Food”. The cursor blinks on the screen. “Top ten” is nothing. No one wants another top ten list of anything, let alone of celebrities eating.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>“Why is this my life?” I ask the typewriter. I shift on the couch, and the groan of the furniture sounds like my mother sighing. I have to stop myself from rolling my eyes and pulling my stomach in. She’s not here, I tell myself. I try to strike up a conversation with the typewriter again.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>“I have to write a damn listicle, and it’ll probably be read by a million times more people than have ever read my short stories. I can’t believe this is what I’m doing. That everything has amounted to this.” There’s still no response. I look down at my empty glass and realize maybe I shouldn’t be waiting for one.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I’m tipsier than I expected. Or maybe I did expect this. Maybe I knew what I was doing. “Maybe I do this on purpose.” I let the empty apartment hold the thought, as if the words are a cloud of smoke lingering heavy and stale in the air. The typewriter stares at me. “Shut up,” I tell it, shoving the coffee table with my foot. The typewriter slides a few inches, and my mother’s cold, angry laughter echoes in the jangling sounds of the broken pieces.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I need to eat something. There are crackers; somewhere, I think. But I’ve hidden all possible snack-like foods up on the highest shelves so I’m not tempted to eat them. It works. I don’t want to put in the work of getting them down. So more gin should be fine. I’ll just suck on the lemon rind if I get hungry.<br></p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="6-chrissy-teigen-the-ultimate-girlchefbossgoals">#6: Chrissy Teigen, the Ultimate #GirlChefBossGoals<a class="hash-link" href="#6-chrissy-teigen-the-ultimate-girlchefbossgoals" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Chrissy Teigen. Miss Chrissy. Mrs. Teigen. Mrs. John Legend. Mother of two, The (former) Queen of Twitter, author of Cravings: Recipes for All of the Food You Want to Eat and Cravings: Hungry for More. Girl, do you ever know cravings.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->As we can see from this delectable shot of her pouring honey all over what looks like fried chicken, Miss Chrissy has built her brand around good food and eating whatever you want. Which I’m sure she does, given that she’s a model who’s appeared in Maxim as well as several Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. It’s so inspiring to see Chrissy as the face of the girl with the metabolism to eat what she wants while looking like an advertisement for plastic surgery—which she’s had, by the way. And good for her! We all deserve to build the body we want.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Either way, Miss Chrissy has built an entire brand out of satisfying your #Cravings. So why shouldn’t we celebrate her? Sure, the only pictures you’ll ever find of her actually eating something are shot by paparazzi as she stuffs her face, looking guilty and regretful. And sure, the artfully shot photos of food that adorn her Instagram profile never feature a picture of her actually consuming anything, but hey! She’s sooo super proud of being able to eat whatever she wants. Probably because it makes her sooo super relatable.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->I bet that’s why she fakes it the way she does—because let’s be honest, it’s all fake. Everything she eats and cooks and bakes makes her so much closer to the public, so much cooler. She fakes it because otherwise, she’d be untouchable, unattainable, unprofitable. I get that, Chrissy. I too am a hard, empty shell trying to seem kind and cool and caring, and sometimes, food is the only way I can ever reach anybody. I repulse myself, Chrissy. Do you repulse yourself too?<br></p></blockquote><hr><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Finding pictures of famous women eating is honestly harder than it seems. Decent ones, anyways. Google has tens of thousands of pages of results for “Rihanna eating” and “Kim Kardashian eating”, but it’s like panning for gold in your bathroom sink. I don’t want to use the awful paparazzi shots where the angle makes them look like they’re animals attacking the food, gorging themselves after starvation. Somehow, the photos of glitzed-out women holding tiny appetizers at awards show afterparties are worse. Relief and anger and sorrow are all etched deep into their face, captured in the flash as if they’re thieves, caught trying to sneak a bite.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I spend most of my time browsing through the third kind of photos, amazed at just how many there are. These are the photos shot on a professional set, with women posing in front of enough food for a family of four, smiling like they’re on a wild cocktail of uppers. Like they’re not thinking about how many calories it’s costing them just to smell the grease on this stuff. Sometimes they hold up a spoonful of the food, sometimes it actually appears to be in their mouths. Not once do I believe they actually eat a single bite.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I shut my laptop, harder than I meant to. I don’t want to use any of these photos. None of them are flattering, none of them say anything except how desperate these women are. Desperate to be seen, to be captured with food, desperate to be relatable to the writhing masses who actually eat real meals. Maybe I could write about that. “I could do that, right?” I ask the typewriter. “Foodie culture and the desperation of the modern celebrity?” It doesn’t respond. I couldn’t do that. Desperation doesn’t sell. And it’s not like pointing out our culture’s intense disgust and obsession with women who eat in public is going to be able to coexist with a link to “10 ways to lose those last 10 pounds!”</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>My gin looks sad, just a little bit left in the glass by itself. It looks lonely. It wouldn’t hurt to have just one more drink. I need to stop having such high standards for myself, for my writing. I need to just write the damn listicle about how obsessed we are with what women eat and what that says about them. This is supposed to be fun. I’m supposed to be having fun.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>“I’m having fun,” I announce to the typewriter. Silence. I want it to talk back, I want to debate it, I want it to tell me I’m being pretentious, that this is the shit people enjoy reading, that I need to stop thinking of myself as better than them. That I’m just as vapid and tacky as everybody else. It won’t. And I won’t. I have gin to drink and soup to make. And it’s a typewriter.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Stepping away from the fridge with a full glass, I make eye contact with the typewriter again. It stares me down, the uneven keys forming a jagged sneer. Watching me like my mother used to, half amused, half disgusted. “Oh, fuck off,” I mutter, “You’re not my mother.” The words are heavy in my mouth. I’m rooted here, trapped in this spot by the typewriter. I can hear my heartbeat. The shrill siren of the oven timer starts to wail. I jump, my heart pounding, and nearly drop my glass. I silence the timer, pull the tray out, and leave the blackened and bubbling squash to cool. They’ve got a good twenty minutes before I’ll be able to handle them. That’s fine. I can wait.<br></p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="4-anne-hathaways-cupcake-snack">#4: Anne Hathaway’s Cupcake Snack<a class="hash-link" href="#4-anne-hathaways-cupcake-snack" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Oh to be Anne, snacking on cupcakes from a Whole Foods bag, shovelling in cupcake after cupcake. I can only imagine that luxury, being able to eat whatever you want and stay scary-skinny. Except maybe it’s not a luxury. Maybe she’s deeply regretful of each bite, but unable to stop. I get like that sometimes, where I think I’ll never feel full. I get that look too, the one she’s got in these photos. That look that says: this is not enjoyable, this is a chore. That says: this is not savouring, it’s masticating. Clinical. Removed. A task to get through. It’s what my mother used to look like when she ate. My mother really did a number on me. I wouldn’t be surprised if she managed to fuck Anne up too.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Poor Anne. This picture reminds me of when I’d get home from school and eat whatever was in the fridge, ignoring my mother’s carefully typed diet plan stuck to the door. She’d walk in on me stuffing my face, starving, out of control. My punishment was always to copy out the diet 50 times, using the creaky old typewriter my mother had owned since I was a baby. If you can believe it, the sadistic bitch left it to me in her will. The joke, of course, is on her, because that thing is banged up and broken and means nothing. More than that, I can snack on anything I want now that she’s gone. Even now, I’m chewing on the rind of a lemon. It’s delicious.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->So I’ve been there, and I say; snack on, Anne. You deserve it.<br></p></blockquote><hr><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Scooping the flesh from the squash is a satisfying task. I pull the spoon towards me, watching the orange pulp curl up. I do this again and again, careful not to pierce the now-soft skin, leaving the halves hollowed out, perfect moulds of themselves. This is my favourite part. Making it empty. There’s something about the softness of the skin, of the care that I have to take to get every ounce of flesh out of its shell and into the blender. Once cleaned out, I pour vegetable stock, minced garlic, canned coconut milk, and a tiny amount of maple syrup into the blender. I turn it on for a minute or two. Or maybe it’s longer than that. Maybe I wander into the bathroom and stare at myself in the mirror, pulling at the skin on my face, wondering when it was that I started to look just like my mother. Maybe I decide to take up smoking. Maybe I call myself a few names, pinch at my stomach, sneer into the mirror. Maybe I lose track of time trying to figure who the person I’m staring at actually is, because it couldn’t be me.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Once the soup is blended, I pour some into a mug and warm it in the microwave. I’m supposed to simmer it on the stove for as long as I can, letting all the flavours steep together as the golden liquid bubbles. But I can’t wait any longer to eat. Dan would reprimand me, tell me that nothing is so pressing it can’t be done the right way. He never liked using the microwave. He claimed he could taste the difference, that the patience it took to heat something on the stove was a virtue. He was kind of a snob, but I loved that about him. He had high expectations for the world around him. And what do I have? Soup, gin, and the typewriter.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I spoon the rest of the soup into jars, stuff them into the fridge. I step back and assess the containers, proud of myself, of the delicious and satisfying meal that I’ve managed to pull together after today. This is what an exceptional person would do. I am an exceptional person. I let out a breath, turn my back on the fridge. The typewriter enters my line of sight. It glares at me. I glare back. Nothing happens. I need to start this listicle. I can’t do it. “I can’t do it,” I tell the typewriter. No answer.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>The microwave beeps. My soup is hot, and I burn my tongue on the first spoonful, unable to taste it. I add a little more coconut milk and try again. This time, it’s right. It tastes like I was a starving, feral cat and someone has offered me shelter. It was worth it, the hour and a half of work for a cup of soup, it was all worth it. I finally feel warm again. I grab a blanket from my bedroom and curl up on the couch, mug of soup in one hand, gin on the table. “Ok. No. I can do this. I can get over myself,” I tell the typewriter. It stares back at me. It looks almost bored, as if of course I would come to that realization, of course eventually I’d see that it was right, that problem was entirely in my attitude. I swear I can hear my mother tapping her fingers on the table, like she used to when she was waiting for me to apologize for not seeing things her way. But there’s nothing but buzzing silence and the faint sounds of feet on the stairwell outside my door. “I can do this,” I say again, and settle into the couch, warm from the inside out.<br></p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="3-rihannas-stolen-wine-glass">#3: Rihanna’s Stolen Wine Glass<a class="hash-link" href="#3-rihannas-stolen-wine-glass" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->The icon herself, Miss Ri-Ri, the baddest ‘gyal,’ Robyn Rihanna Fenty. Honestly, there never was a badder bitch. And there’s no one else who could pull off carrying a glass of wine across the street. Absolutely unbothered, slaying an all-white outfit, all eyes on her drink. I can only aspire to be like Miss Fenty. This girl is totally committed to her booze too—this isn’t her first time with a glass of wine in public. She’s actually been crowned “Queen of Taking Wine Glasses to Go”. <br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->You know, I see these pictures, and suddenly I don’t feel so bad when I get home at 5 pm and tear the foil off my second bottle of the week and drink it all by myself. Well. Not all by myself. I have a typewriter. We’re like The Odd Couple. I’m a slob, and it’s a typewriter. Whatever. That’s besides the point. And the point is, just like Rihanna, I love a glass or two or three of wine to end my evening. <br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->My mother was nothing like Rihanna. She never drank. She said it was too many calories for something liquid. She was an angry woman, and I think drinking probably would have made her even angrier. Instead, she smoked. Almost constantly. I found a picture of her recently where she wasn’t smoking, and it was honestly hard to recognize my own mother without a cloud of smoke around her mouth. She always said smoking was the perfect vice, the opposite of drinking—it doesn’t cost you any calories, and it kills your appetite. Course, it also kills you early, a slow and painful death in a shitty hospital. But we all have our vices. I drink, my mother smoked, and Rihanna steals wine glasses. Keep on being the baddest, babe.<br></p></blockquote><hr><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>An hour later I am halfway through a treatise on how these shitty food shots actually make these women the most boss-ass bitches to ever walk a red carpet. Though the mug is empty, my stomach is still warm from the soup. Maybe from the gin, too. I go to take another sip and find the glass empty. Gnawing on the bitter rind of the lemon, I extricate myself from the couch. Standing takes more effort than it should. This might be drink four, maybe drink five, but who’s here to say anything? No one. It’s just the typewriter that sits in the living room with me. I can feel it watching as I stumble unevenly into the kitchen and pull the gin from the freezer. I pour another drink, adding the last of the ice. Turning on the tap, I reach for the empty ice tray and fumble it, knocking my glass into the sink. It shatters against the metal basin, gin pouring down the drain. Fuck.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>The ice and glass shards mix under the still-running tap. The glass is still mostly intact, except for a large jagged edge where it made contact with the metal. It’s not like there’s anyone here to help me with this, so I take a moment to watch the water running over the glass. I realize my hands are gripping the edge of the counter tighter and tighter, like I’m trying to hold on to something. Like I’m the one that’s falling.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I turn the water off and fish the glass out of the sink, slicing my hand in the process. It doesn’t hurt. I wrap my bleeding palm in a tea towel patterned with dancing radishes. Standing there, watching the blood seep into the tea towel, I can still feel the typewriter watching me. I stare at it, daring it to break the silence that fills the space between the dripping from the faucet. Dare it to speak to me, to use my mother’s voice. It just stares back, defiant as ever. “Fine!” I yell, breaking eye contact. “Fine! You win! I’m a mess! I’m writing about nothing and none of it means anything, you were right! I’m fucking it up, just like always!” The typewriter keeps its cool. I pour another drink.<br></p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="1-kristen-bell-posing-with-roasted-small-potatoes">#1: Kristen Bell Posing With Roasted Small-Potatoes<a class="hash-link" href="#1-kristen-bell-posing-with-roasted-small-potatoes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Kristen Bell is really the epitome of the American dream. She’s got a dreamy husband, two perfect little girls, she’s blonde and thin and gorgeous and seems super down to earth. I think we’d all like to be her best friend. But I can’t get over this picture.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->I mean, Kristen, <em>come on</em>. The doe-eyed, “oops, did I just eat that?” look, sucking on your finger, holding out a spoonful of what actually looks like a deeply healthy dish of roasted small-potatoes and something green. It’s a little infantile, a little maternal, the best kind of porn. You pull it off, of course. You look poised, cozy, motherly, and sexy all at once. I bet your husband loved it.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->I have tried for my entire life to capture everything you so effortlessly depict in this photo. I’m sure you’ll say it’s retouched, but honestly Kristen, I’m pretty sure this is just how you look. Everytime I would try this pose in the kitchen, my ex-boyfriend, Dan, would get mad and make me wash my hands again. He was kind of anal about stuff like that. Honestly, he was kind of anal about a lot of things. The first time he ever really saw me, messy and drunk and wild-eyed, he got mad. Like, really mad. He told me I was better than that. He’s not a bad guy. I was a bad girlfriend. I never learned how to be maternal, so all I knew how to do was pretend. I was really good at pretending. But then my mother died.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->I don’t know if you’ve had a parent die, Kristen. Especially if it’s your only parent. It’s kind of a lot to deal with. Especially when it came to my mother. She looked a lot like you, Kristen, skinny and blonde. But I don’t think you would have liked her. I didn’t much like her. But that doesn’t matter now, because she’s dead. Except now it seems like that makes it matter so much more than it did before. Because now she’s dead, and I don’t get the chance to like her ever again. My mother managed to fuck up one last thing when she died—I got sad. I know what you’re saying. “I’m so sorry to hear that. That must have been hard. But it’s okay to be sad.” You’re right, Kristen.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->What’s not okay is when the sadness creeps into your chest and lungs and burrows itself inside your head. When it tells you to stay home alone and get drunk, to stop pretending and let your boyfriend see the real you. Cause that’s when it all goes to shit, Kristen. It all gets fucked up from there. From this picture, it doesn’t seem like you would know anything about how fucked up this kinda stuff can get. And that’s ok. I don’t wish it on anyone.<br>
<!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Just eat the damn potatoes, Kristen.</p></blockquote><hr><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>The next morning, I wake up, head pounding. My mouth is dry, and my sheets smell like gin. I roll over and grab my phone from where I dropped it between the bed and the nightstand. It’s hours past when I should’ve been at work. Except I don’t have to do that anymore. As I’m swiping through Instagram stories, feeling nauseous at every loop of people clinking glasses, a text pops up. It’s from Dan.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>“Hey, you okay this morning? Just wanted to make sure you were going to be alright.” The embarrassment is a sucker punch. He’s a great guy. Why wouldn’t he be checking in on me? I wince as I scroll through the series of texts I sent him before I passed out last night—a jumble of eggplant emojis, apologies, and confessions. “Thx for checking in, I’m fine. Sorry about tht. I swear it won’t happen again.” He doesn’t respond. This is the fourth time I’ve made that promise.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I stumble into the kitchen, desperate for water. There’s still shards of glass in the sink, and the jagged line down my palm stings. The mug sits on the coffee table, crusted over now with the remnants of soup. After collecting it and depositing it beside the sink, I consider making coffee. That seems like a lot of work right now. I abandon the idea and choose instead to pull my body into a fetal position on the couch. My eyes hurt and my mouth tastes like bile.</p><p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>I scroll through my email, barely registering the words.Some of my coworkers, who have noticed I am not at my desk, have reached out to see if I’m feeling okay, because they’re so surprised I’m not there. I didn’t even miss this much work for my mother’s funeral. There’s a response from my editor. She expresses her sadness at my departure, says that she’ll be a reference in the future, and that she understands I need a change of pace. Bitch. As if it’s my fault for not fitting in with the environment, as if she shouldn’t be expected to accommodate the sadness of other people. Except I guess that’s true. I guess that’s true for everyone.</p><span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4vw"></span>Another email comes through, this time from my agent. The swooshing sound makes my stomach flip, and I have to breathe through my nose for a moment before I can read it. It’s short, to the point. She’s confused, but glad that I’ve started on a new project. She hopes I’m feeling okay. She asks me for the recipe.<br><p></p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/Writing Samples/defining-the-word-wanting"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Defining The Word &#x27;Wanting&#x27;</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/Writing Samples/am-in-the-greenhouse-we-call-bed"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">2 am In The Greenhouse We Call Bed</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_cNA8 thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#9-zendaya-sneaking-some-sweet-potato-fries" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">#9: Zendaya Sneaking Some Sweet Potato Fries</a></li><li><a href="#7-kim-kardashian-west-showing-off-vegan-tacos-on-ig-live" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">#7: Kim Kardashian-West Showing Off Vegan Tacos on IG Live</a></li><li><a href="#6-chrissy-teigen-the-ultimate-girlchefbossgoals" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">#6: Chrissy Teigen, the Ultimate #GirlChefBossGoals</a></li><li><a href="#4-anne-hathaways-cupcake-snack" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">#4: Anne Hathaway’s Cupcake Snack</a></li><li><a href="#3-rihannas-stolen-wine-glass" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">#3: Rihanna’s Stolen Wine Glass</a></li><li><a href="#1-kristen-bell-posing-with-roasted-small-potatoes" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">#1: Kristen Bell Posing With Roasted Small-Potatoes</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 Kathleen McCulloch-Cop.

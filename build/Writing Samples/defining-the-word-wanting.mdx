<RightAlign><i>written June 2021, published in Stem to Sternum January 2022</i></RightAlign>

<p>I suck on a rag dipped in anaesthetic. <br/>
That’s what we call it, now, at least. <br/>
The birds are back, breaking the glass <br/>
with their small ribcages, their dollhouse bones, <br/>
as if in heat, as if in protest, <br/>
as if they are the predators <br/>
of their ancestry. It’s loud, <br/>
like something to fear <br/>
in that way that makes us believe <br/>
in a predisposition to faith.</p>

<p>I never knew where to look, <br/>
I’d end up drinking the stillness in. <br/>
The leaves knew what to say, <br/>
the lustre of blood, <br/>
a dance in the moonlight, <br/>
<Tab>my smaller body leaning</Tab> <br/>
<Tab><Tab>towards the stardust</Tab></Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab><Tab>and coughing up bile.</Tab></Tab></Tab></p>

<RightAlign> Every passing flatbed is convinced of its independence, <br/>
my feet turn to ash on the road. <br/>
I stare at the man who says prayers <br/>
as if to make a difference <br/>
in the shape of the words. <br/>
He scoops me up, hand around my legs. <br/>
I lean my head on his shoulder, <br/>
watch the road bounce out of view. <br/>
I am deposited in bed. <br/>
I will learn I cannot climb<br/>
in this hallowed space, it’s something <br/>
artless, something I wouldn’t mind.<br/></RightAlign>

<p>By the way, it’s all a lie. <br/>
I think it is, at least, <br/>
<Tab>because it happened where the pavement</Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab>becomes altar, and the farmhouse</Tab></Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab><Tab>is swallowed by the man</Tab></Tab></Tab><br/>
<RightAlign>who erects statues of glory<br/>
to a different kind of god.</RightAlign>
<Tab><Tab><Tab>Oranges toppling onto our heads,</Tab></Tab></Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab>and rabbit caught out back,</Tab></Tab><br/>
<Tab>and the mangy cats</Tab><br/>
sparkling their eyes up the walkway, <br/>
as if embarrassed to show us their starving spines.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a childhood <br/>
unscathed. But it wasn’t <br/>
at war, and we never knew <br/>
where the animals took their older bodies <br/>
when they left this place behind.   <br/>
<Tab>It was as close as we could get</Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab>to church. Not that there wasn't</Tab></Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab><Tab>a church, there is,</Tab></Tab></Tab><br/>
<RightAlign>we sit on the steps, and count<br/>
the beetles with our hands, but the water <br/>
takes what it wants. It always will.</RightAlign></p>

<p>After that time, after we knew <br/>
how to build pyres, <br/>
how to harvest garlic, <br/>
that was the place we knew <br/>
how to build out of old bones. <br/>
<Tab>It was a horror movie, I would say,</Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab>and laugh, and wince. We’ve all been dead</Tab></Tab><br/>
<RightAlign>in some way, I guess. <br/>
But it’s not new, it’s been marching <br/>
through the pasture <br/>
ever since we could see that far.</RightAlign></p>

<p align="right">I can follow all of it, <br/>
any curves or hills that make<br/>
the map different year to year. <br/>
My eyes can only take in so much:<br/>
growing moss between the houses,<br/>
our toes stuck with soot.</p>

<p align="right"> We keep score by our own count. <br/>
We own the rules. We hunt them back, <br/>
but each new name is more confusing than the last, <br/>
we spin in place, I try to learn to read <br/>
the epitaphs of women watching <br/>
our mosquito legs, the soles<br/>
of our small and flashing feet. </p>

<RightAlign>We run to something wild. <br/>
It’s not shameful. It feels shameful, <br/>
everything coloured through the lens of heat, <br/>
something about nature versus nurture. <br/></RightAlign>
<Tab><Tab><Tab>I know it, but its stuck between</Tab></Tab></Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab>my strands of briar hair. We sank</Tab></Tab><br/>
<Tab>to our knees on the black tar,</Tab><br/>
<p>the dog holding our gaze, <br/>
it all happens in an instant, doesn’t it? <br/>
Maybe you’re right.</p>

<p>Maybe my short fingers <br/>
would never reach the crocodiles, <br/>
swinging their tails, receding, <br/>
but who’s to say? I don’t like <br/>
to make words of that story. <br/>
I was a bloodied day, <br/>
but at the end of it, we weren’t.</p>

<p>I think that that was everything, <br/>
the gravel drive, the red mailbox, <br/>
<Tab>a woman smoking, standing,</Tab><br/>
<Tab><Tab>calling my name, and my short limbs</Tab></Tab><br/>
<RightAlign>sprinting down the road that leads to all of it.</RightAlign></p>
